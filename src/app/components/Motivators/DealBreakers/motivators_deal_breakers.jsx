                 <p className="mb-6">Dealbreakers include people who bad mouth their partners. It instantly makes me we wary of you and think that we are not like minded people. Also, co-workers who do not pull their own weight but talk as if they do. Any sort of group team building or work diner outside of work hours I will never attend. Absolute biggest deal breaker of all time is mix and mingle, social networking type work functions with people who I do not know. I just do not go to these anymore.</p>
